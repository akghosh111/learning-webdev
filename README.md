# Web Development Learning Repository

Welcome to my web development learning journey! This repository is a collection of projects and code that I am working on as I learn web development from scratch. I am following the curriculum provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and I'm committed to documenting my progress by regularly pushing my projects to this repository.

## Learning Path

I am currently focusing on the fundamentals of web development, including:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Structuring content for the web.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Styling and designing web pages.
- **JavaScript (JS):** Adding interactivity and dynamic elements to websites.

## Projects

Each project in this repository represents a milestone in my learning process. You can explore the projects individually to see the evolution of my skills and understanding of web development.

## Live Streams

I am sharing my learning journey with the community through live streaming on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AnukiranGhosh/streams). Feel free to join my live sessions, ask questions, and provide feedback.
